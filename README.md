# WordSearch
WordSearch program written for COP 3502

This code was written in the fall of 2015. This program takes in a given wordsearch puzzle
that follows the established format and will relay the location of the words if they are
within the puzzle or if they simply are not.

wordsearch.h and dictionary.txt are required to run the program

Code can be run by compiling with gcc and entering the command:
./a.out < input.txt > output.txt
